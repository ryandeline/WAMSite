It combines a wide angle laser scanner that gives us the opportunity to extract the most comprehensive datasets for your project.  This state of the art sensor combines a 400kHz laser with an integrated medium-format digital frame camera supplying robust point clouds with high-quality digital images collected simultaneously for ortho rectification.</p><p align="justify">The Trimble Harrier 68i uses Multiple-Time-Around Technology to allow for multiple laser pulses and echoes in the air, increasing the point density of the mission.</p><p align="justify">This sensor is the ideal solution for wide area mapping, power-line mapping, pipeline monitoring and corridor mapping.</p>

							<p align="justify">For many decades Carl Zeiss Photogrammetry Division developed and manufactured high performance aerial photography systems.  Since October 1999 and Zeiss' collaborative introduction of the company, Z/I Imaging, many advances have been made in aerial imagery collection.  The DMC panchromatic digital sensor (Digital Mapping Camera) was born out of this effort.</p><p align="justify">The DMC construct was a revolutionary one.  It was developed to contain 4 panchromatic sensor modules and up to 4 additional multi-spectral camera modules.  In the post-flight processing the 4 panchromatic images are stitched together to make one large-format high resolution image.  The new high res image is then combined with the desired additional multi-spectral channels for a remarkably high resolution panchromatic color or color infrared imagery.  The DMC is gyroscopically stabilized and equipped with forward motion control.</p><p align="justify"></p><p align="justify">This sensor is the ideal solution for wide area mapping, county mapping, urban mapping and is excellent for all other large-format mapping requirements.</p>
